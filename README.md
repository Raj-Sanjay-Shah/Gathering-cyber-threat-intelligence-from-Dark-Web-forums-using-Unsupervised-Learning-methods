# Gathering-cyber-threat-intelligence-from-Dark-Web-forums-using-Unsupervised-Learning-methods

Project work does as a part of course CS F376. 

 Traditional processes for cyber-threat intelligence are inherently reactive to known threats, in this project, we aim to develop proactive cyber-threat intelligence capabilities in online forums to identify emerging threats. We generate document embeddings of the topics present in the Iron March web forum using contemporary graph-based methods such as Variational Graph Autoencoder and Structural Deep Network Embedding. One of the most exciting finds is that the shifts in the generated graph embeddings over different time stamps can be visualized by solving the orthogonal procrustes problem, allowing us to recognize the changes in the document embedding as more posts are added in various topics.
